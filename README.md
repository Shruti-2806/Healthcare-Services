Healthcare Services Management Application

This is a simple React web application for managing and displaying a list of healthcare services. Users can add, update, and delete services from the list.

Features

1. **Service List**: Displays a list of healthcare services, including the name, description, and price of each service.
2. **Add New Service**: Allows users to add a new service using a form. Once submitted, the new service is added to the list.
3. **Update Service**: Enables users to update the details of an existing service (name, description, price).
4. **Delete Service**: Provides functionality to remove a service from the list.
5. **State Management**: Uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) to manage the state of the services.

### Bonus Features:
- Form validation: Ensures all fields are filled out before a new service is added.
- Application styled using basic CSS or UI framework like Bootstrap.
